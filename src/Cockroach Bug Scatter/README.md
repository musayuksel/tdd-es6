# Story

It was nearly midnight when I staggered sleepily into the kitchen to get a glass of milk...

I turned on the light and... AARRRGGHHHHH!!!!

Damn bugs scatter in all directions!

I really hate cockroaches

## Kata Task

The cockroaches run and hide in the numbered holes.

Return array/list showing how many cockroaches end up in each hole (index matches the hole number)

### Notes About cockroaches:

- There are 0 or more cockroaches in the room
- Cockroaches firstly run in a straight line in the direction they are facing
- When they hit a wall they always turn LEFT and then they follow the wall until they can find a hole to crawl into!
- Cockroaches do not bump into each other
- There are no cockroaches outside the room

### About the room:

- The room is a closed rectangle
- There are 1 or more holes (conveniently numbered by a single digit)
- Hole numbers are random but not repeated

Legend:

`+, |, - ` walls of the room

`0 - 9 ` holes for cockroaches to hide in

`U,D,L,R ` cockroaches with initial directions facing `UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT`

## Example

```
[
      "+----------------0---------------+",
      "|                                |",
      "|                                |",
      "|          U        D            |",
      "|     L                          |",
      "|              R                 |",
      "|           L                    |",
      "|  U                             1",
      "3        U    D                  |",
      "|         L              R       |",
      "|                                |",
      "+----------------2---------------+"
]
```

Result:
(always 10 elements)

```
[1, 2, 2, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```
